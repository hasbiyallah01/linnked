🌸 Linnked Send a meaningful message, with a Linnk

Linnked is a fun little project I’m working on to help students connect in a safe, exciting, and meaningful way.

It started with Valentine’s Day in mind, but honestly, it’s something that works any time of the year. With Linnked, you can send someone an anonymous, thoughtful, or even playful message using fun prompts and shared interests. If they like it, they can reply and if both people are into it, they can choose to reveal who they are. It’s all about creating safe, joyful moments instead of awkward or random interactions.

What is Linnked?
Linnked is an anonymous messaging platform that’s still in development. Here’s what you can do for now:
-Sign up with your school email (so it’s safe and trusted)
-Answer fun prompts that show off your personality
-Send a Linnk (an anonymous message) to someone you admire
-Get a reply only if they approve your Linnk
-Download the flashvcards of your message
-decide the format and preference of the way you wnat the message to render

It’s like passing a note in class but safer, smarter, and more fun.

Why Linnked?
Most apps just throw people into random chats. That’s not what I wanted. Linnked is built to be:
Personal → guided by prompts, not generic “hey” messages
Safe → verified with emails + no forced reveals
Meaningful → for students who actually want deeper connections
Fun → perfect for Valentine’s Day, campus events, or just making someone smile on a random Tuesday

How it Works
Sign up with your email
Answer prompts to make your profile fun and unique
Send a Linnk (your anonymous message)
Wait for approval → they get to decide if they want to reply
Download your message and decide to keep them

Where It’s At
Linnked is still in development . Right now I’m working on:
Anonymous messaging + moderation
Prompt-driven profiles
The approval/reveal flow
The reveal of personality

My Reflection
What It Is
Linnked is basically my attempt at creating a safe, fun way for students to connect—kind of like a digital Valentine’s note, but with privacy built in.

Why I Made It
I’ve seen how hard it can be for students to express themselves, and I wanted to make something that helps break that wall without making anyone uncomfortable. The goal was simple: let people share feelings in a way that’s fun, lighthearted, and safe.

How I Built It
I focused on three things:
Safety → verified emails
Personality → smart prompts
Control → anonymous messages + consent-based reveals

Struggles & Learnings
Struggles: Balancing fun with safety, avoiding spam, and making sure prompts encourage real connections instead of generic “hi’s.”

Learnings: I discovered how important trust is in building social apps, how to design privacy first flows, and how even small features (like prompts) can totally shape the kind of interactions people have.

Honestly, working on Linnked has taught me that social tools aren’t just about code, they’re about making people feel comfortable enough to be themselves.
