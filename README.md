🌸 Linnked – Send a meaningful message, with a Linnk

Linnked is a playful yet thoughtful platform designed to help students build meaningful social connections in a safe and exciting way.

Inspired by Valentine’s Day (but made for any time of the year), Linnked lets students send anonymous, heartfelt, or fun messages through smart prompts and shared academic interests. By keeping identities hidden until there’s mutual consent, the platform ensures that interactions are joyful, safe, and respectful.

🚀 What is Linnked?

Linnked is an anonymous student matching and messaging platform currently in development.

The platform helps students:
✅ Sign up securely with verified student emails
✅ Express personality by answering fun, smart prompts
✅ Send anonymous messages to someone they admire or care about
✅ Give/receive meaningful responses if the recipient approves the Linnk
✅ Choose to reveal identities only when both parties agree

🌸 Think of it as a safe, fun, and meaningful way to spark new friendships, connections, and joyful moments in schools and universities.

🎯 Why Linnked?

Most student matching platforms focus on random pairings or generic chats. Linnked is different:
📝 Context-aware prompts → Messages aren’t random; they’re guided by smart, personality-driven prompts.
🔒 Privacy first → All signups are verified with student emails, and identities are never revealed unless both users opt in.
💌 Meaningful connections → Designed for students who want to go beyond shallow interactions.
🎉 Event-based fun → Perfect for Valentine’s Day, campus events, or just for sparking joy on ordinary days.

🌟 How it Works
Sign Up → Students register using their school email to ensure a trusted environment.
Build Profile → Answer fun, engaging prompts to shape your personality profile.
Send a Linnk → Write a heartfelt or playful anonymous message to someone.
Wait for Approval → If the recipient likes the Linnk, they can respond.
Reveal (Optional) → If both parties agree, identities are revealed and the connection goes beyond anonymous.
