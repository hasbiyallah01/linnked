🌸 Linnked
“Send a meaningful message – with a Linnk.”

Linnked is a platform designed to anonymously match students on Valentine’s Day (and beyond), using smart prompts and class-based interests to help them send meaningful messages while keeping interactions safe, exciting, and context-aware.

🚀 What is Linnked?
Linnked is currently in development.

The vision is to create an anonymous student matching platform where students can:

✅ Sign up securely using their student emails
✅ Answer fun, smart prompts to build personality profiles
✅ Send meaningful messages anonymously to someone they love
✅ Receive a response if the recipient approves the Linnk
✅ Reveal identities only if both parties agree

With Linnked, you can send a message to someone you love anonymously, and if they approve it, you get a response, opening the door for a joyful, safe connection.

The goal is to build joyful, safe, and meaningful social connections in academic environments during Valentine’s Day or similar events.
